# 🌊 FloodSense: Data Driven Prediction for Safer Communities

FloodSense is a data-driven machine learning project and interactive web application built to predict flood risk based on environmental and infrastructural factors. By leveraging predictive analytics, FloodSense empowers citizens, city planners, and disaster response teams to make informed decisions and safeguard communities from flood-related hazards.

> 💡 Combining machine learning insights with real-time prediction in a simple, responsive web app.
